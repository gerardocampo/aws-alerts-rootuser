# aws-alerts-rootuser

**Purpose:**
It is advised not to use the AWS Root account[^1], except for tasks that require it.[^2]
  Now with this, you can get **email alerts** *whenever the AWS Root account is used*.

This CloudFormation template will use a .Zip file archive in an S3 bucket, which has a Python Lambda function[^3], 
and will create the following resources:
  
- CF Stack
- EventBridge Rule
- SNS Topic & Subscription(s)
- Lambda Function & Application
- IAM Role & In-line Policy (for Lambda Function)
  
  
The CFN template & Lambda package is based on:
- https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/root-user-account-eventbridge-rule/
- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/monitor-and-notify-on-aws-account-root-user-activity/
  
  
## **IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU USE THIS**:  
  
  ### FIRST: 
1. **Zip** up the *RootActivityLambda.py*, and **upload** it to an S3 bucket.
  - *Command in macOS:*  
  ```
  zip -r -X RootActivityLambda.zip RootActivityLambda.py
  ```
  - Upload this *RootActivityLambda.zip* file to your S3 bucket in this AWS account.
  
  
  ### THEN: 
2. **Specify where the S3 bucketname and path of the zip** file is, in the CF template.
  - In the file *RootActivity.yaml*, find the `AWS::Lambda::Function` function, and update the values for `S3Bucket` and `S3Key`.
    - `S3Bucket` is the name of the S3 bucket you uploaded the file to.
    - `S3Key` is the path and filename.
    - So for example if the path of where you uploaded to is `S3:\\lmbda-functions\CF\RootActivityLambda.zip` 
      - _then_ the `S3Bucket` is `lmbda-functions` 
      - and the `S3Key` is `CF/RootActivityLambda.zip`.
  
  ### LASTLY: 
3. Enter the **email address**(es) to receive the notifications.  
  - In the file *RootActivity.yaml*, find the `EmailSubscription` section(s), 
    - _where necessary_ **uncomment** lines (and add additional SNS subscriptions) 
    - and check/update the value of the `Endpoint:` key.  
    - **SAVE IT.**


## Now, you're READY TO DEPLOY:
  if you're using AWS CLI and invoking CF, 
  you'll need the `CAPABILITY_IAM` & `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capabilities:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name AWSRootUserAlerts \
  --template-body file://RootActivity.yaml \
  --capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM" "CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM"
```
  
## For Troubleshooting

- *If need be*, enable debugging: go to Lambda --> Functions --> `NameOfCFStack`Function, and uncomment out the `logger.debug` lines in the Python script.
- **But definitely go to** CloudWatch --> Log groups --> /aws/lambda/`NameOfCFStack`.
